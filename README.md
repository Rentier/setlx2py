The homepage for setlX can be found on <http://randoom.org/Software/SetlX>.

## Parser

Load the parser and start an interactive shell with

    make parser

You can now use the **parser** variable to parse text:

    >>> parser.parse("a;")
    ('FileAST', ('Identifier', 'a'))

## AST

Rebuild the AST classes (needs ast-gen installed):

    make ast

## Run tests

The unit test suite can be run with

    make test
