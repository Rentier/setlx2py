\subsection{Overview}

Setlx2py consists of two parts: It is a compiler written in the Python programming language to transcompile SetlX sources to Python. In addition to that, it contains the needed runtime libraries. Therefore, when running code generated by setlx2py, an installed setlx2py environment is needed. When the development of setlx2py comes to a stable, binaries for the different target architectures are created simplify the step of installation.

In the following chapters, the steps needed to setup setlx2py on your system are described. It can be run on nearly any platform which has a standard Python implementation. At first, the general dependencies are described. After that, some in-depth guides for installing on Windows, Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS can be found. In the end, the actual usage of setlx2py is briefly explained.

\subsection{Dependencies}

To deal with a target platform which is not described here, or this installation guide becomes outdated, the dependencies necessary to run setlx2py are now explained.

\paragraph{Runtime}

Setlx2py is written in Python, and generates Python source code from SetlX input. Therefore, a Python runtime is needed. Any version starting from Python 2.7 is officially supported. It tested with version numbers 2.7 and 3.3. Older versions may work, but are not recommended nor supported.

\paragraph{Packages}

\begin{itemize}
\item PLY \footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ply}}
\item blist \footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist}}
\item nose (only for testing) \footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose}}
\item ast-gen (only for development) \footnote{\url{https://github.com/Rentier/ast-gen}}
