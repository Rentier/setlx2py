// Problem 6
// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025
//
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
// natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one 
// hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
