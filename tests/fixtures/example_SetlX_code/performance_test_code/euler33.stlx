// Euler problem 33
// """
// The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in 
// attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, 
// is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
//
// We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
//
// There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than 
// one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
//
// If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find 
// the value of the denominator.
