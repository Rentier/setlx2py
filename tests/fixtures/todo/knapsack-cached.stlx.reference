naive algorithm using exhaustive search:
s = {[1, 1, 12], [6, 2, 16], [11, 6, 8], [11, 10, 11], [13, 10, 2], [14, 2, 17], [15, 10, 3], [16, 1, 4], [17, 11, 15], [17, 18, 13], [18, 14, 1], [19, 7, 7], [19, 9, 9], [19, 18, 6]}, value = 196, weight = 119
greedy algorithm using dynamic programming:
s = {[1, 1, 12], [6, 2, 16], [11, 6, 8], [11, 10, 11], [13, 10, 2], [14, 2, 17], [15, 10, 3], [16, 1, 4], [17, 11, 15], [17, 18, 13], [18, 14, 1], [19, 7, 7], [19, 9, 9], [19, 18, 6]}, value = 196, weight = 119
